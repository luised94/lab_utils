# Had to adjust plan to analyze genome with gff file.
# Need to download those files from sgd.
# Files were downloaded manually from SGD.
# For now, use this script to analyze fasta files from SGD
# After downloading to Downloads folder, run:
# $for file in *.fsa;do mv $file "$HOME/data/fasta_files/" ; done
# Switch mv to echo to perform dry-run.
