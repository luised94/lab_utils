## Introduction
Data from next-generation-sequencing experiments is stored in a linux cluster. Code from lab_utils repository/next-generation-sequecing is meant to be used on that data. 

Some of the utils are designed to address the provenance of the data since I work with the MIT Biomicrocenter to generate the libraries, do the sequencing and some additional preprocessing. Furthermore, the samples are named according to their convention, which is YYMMDD<name_of_lab> for example 201001Bel for year, month, day and Bel for the Bell Lab. 

The following is a brief description of the data folders in my data directory.

## 221024Bel
Chromatin immunoprecipitation samples from W303 bar1 delta alpha factor and Nocodazole arrested cells with AID degradation module of ORC4. First troubleshooting experiment to analyze effect of suppressors on ORC and MCM binding. 

## 240324Bel
Second chromatin immunoprecipitation samples after some troubleshooting using CHIP-PCR. Still shows problems with MCM IP using polyclonal antibodies.

## EatonBel
Reference samples from Eaton 2010. Used for comparison to previous experiments.
