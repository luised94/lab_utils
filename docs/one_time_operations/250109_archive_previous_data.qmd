# Archive previously referenced data
I got fastp working. I performed some analysis on the files before realizing that I had to remove the adapter sequences.
Since I have looked at those files, I want to archive them instead of deleting them.

```{bash}
# Define experiment directories
readonly EXPERIMENTS=(241007Bel 241010Bel)
readonly BASE_DIR="$HOME/data"
readonly ARCHIVE_ROOT="$HOME/data/archive/$(date +%Y%m%d)"

# Create archive directory with timestamp
mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_ROOT"

# Strategic archiving with verbose logging
for exp in "${EXPERIMENTS[@]}"; do
    exp_path="${BASE_DIR}/${exp}"
    archive_exp_path="${ARCHIVE_ROOT}/${exp}"

    # Debug print for current experiment
    printf "Processing experiment: %s\n" "$exp"
    printf "Source directory: %s\n" "$exp_path"
    printf "Archive destination: %s\n" "$archive_exp_path"

    # Create experiment-specific archive directory
    mkdir -p "$archive_exp_path"

    # Archive directories with tar, preserving permissions
    for subdir in alignment coverage plots; do
        source_dir="${exp_path}/${subdir}"
        archive_file="${archive_exp_path}/${subdir}.tar.gz"

        if [[ -d "$source_dir" ]]; then
            printf "Archiving %s...\n" "$subdir"
            tar -czf "$archive_file" -C "$exp_path" "$subdir"
            
            # Verify archive creation
            if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
                printf "! Successfully archived %s\n" "$subdir"
            else
                printf "? Failed to archive %s\n" "$subdir" >&2
            fi
        else
            printf "Warning: %s directory not found\n" "$source_dir" >&2
        fi
    done

    printf "\n"
done

# Final summary
printf "Archive complete. Total archives created in %s\n" "$ARCHIVE_ROOT"
```
