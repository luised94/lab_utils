# Common issues when using this repository

## Config files version misaligned.
Most of the time, the config files arent updated to the latest version.
You can open all of them in neovim and update them manually.
```{bash}
nvim ~/data/*Bel/documentation/*_bmc_config.R ~/lab_utils/core_scripts/template_bmc_config.R
```
Add it as an alias to the bashrc.
```{bash}
# Alias to quickly edit configuration files for BMC experiments
alias edit_bmc_configs='nvim ~/data/*Bel/documentation/*_bmc_config.R core_scripts/template_bmc_config.R'
```

Then something that is useful to bulk update the configurations is the following macros:
```{vim}
" Delete section
" Record macro
qq
/ Time Configuration " Top of section
" Depend on comment structure
-
Ctrl+q
" Go to the last section
/ Configuration Validation
$d
q
" Use macro on files manually or
bufdo execute "normal @q" | write
" Alternativelly use args or quick fix list to get the files you want to perform the operation on.
" Yank the section you want to transfer.
" Use similar strategy

" Go to place to proper location and put text
qq
gg
/ EXPERIMENT_CONFIG
" Use search movement, do appropriate number of times.
n
$%
<CR>
put
" This will add a lot of white space.
" From the section you want to delete whitespace from.
qq
Ctrl+q
}{
'<,'>d
q
```

## Files missing for analysis
Scripts should always include input validation to make sure files are present.
Easy solution is to rsync the files from the linux cluster (requires vpn if not working in the MIT campus).
Refer to download scripts to download from scratch.

```{bash}
rsync -nav username@luria.mit.edu:~/data/REFGENS/* ~/data/REFGENS/
```
