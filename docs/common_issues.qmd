# Common issues when using this repository

## Config files version misaligned.
Most of the time, the config files arent updated to the latest version.
You can open all of them in neovim and update them manually.
```{bash}
nvim ~/data/*Bel/documentation/*_bmc_config.R ~/lab_utils/core_scripts/template_bmc_config.R
```
