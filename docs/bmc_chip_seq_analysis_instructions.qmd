title: Quick start instructions for using core scripts to analyze CHIP-seq data
---

# Introduction
This document outlines how to use the scripts in the core_scripts/ directory to analyze data from a BMC experiment. This assumes the directory is clone which can be done using the git clone command. Furthermore, many of the scripts are meant to be run in a cluster environment (See README.md for assumptions). Thus, the user can use their institutions' cluster resources or install the softwares locally and adjust the scripts to use a for loop or a parallel library.
Each script carries out a particular operation along a chip-seq pipeline and requires a particular dependency.

# Protocol
1. Use setup scripts to create the metadata and documentation for the experiment. Synced the directory to the cluster.
2. Download the data to the local directory according to the BMC's email instructions.
 ```{bash}
 srun rsync -av /path/in/BMC/email ~/data/<experiment-id>
 ```
3. Clean up the fastq directory (cleanup_bmc_directory.sh).
 > Run the commands instead of as a script. Files can also be moved and inspected preliminarily. I remove them since I prefer to use my own scripts.
4. Consolidate the fastq files from both lanes (consolidate_fastq.sh). There could be differences between the lanes. However, if one lane has enough reads of good-enough quality, then you do not need to worry.
  > Fastp will filter out the reads either way. 

The next set of scripts run an sbatch file that contains the information for slurm program to administrate the script and resources.

5. Filter the fastq files (submit_fastp_filter.sh).
6. Align the fastq files (submit_bowtie2_alignment.sh).
7. Generate the coverage files (submit_bamcoverage_normalizations.sh).
  > Use the plot_*.R scripts to see the coverage files as genomic tracks.
  > Ensure override_configuration is present in the server using rsync.
  > Recommend running {} and then {}.
8. Call peaks (submit_macs2_peak_calling.sh).
9. TODO: Determine motifs.
10. TODO: Perform factor analysis.
