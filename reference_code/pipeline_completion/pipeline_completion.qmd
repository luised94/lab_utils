title: Pipeline completion documentation
---

# Introduction
This documentation serves as an explanation for the files found in directory ~/lab_utils/reference_code/pipeline_completion/.
The purpose of these scripts is to test combinations of parameters for the commands deeptools, macs2 and meme.
The files used are positive controls from one of my experiments and from a reference article (Eaton 2010).
Most of the scripts use the files from their directory locations but I realized that it was better to copy the files to the testing directory.
I also downloaded the data to my dropbox to have it available without having to use a vpn to access the cluster (sometimes it never connects and I have to restart my computer).

# Vim tricks
If you want to trace the logic of the code by following a variable, you can hover over the variable name and either follow using * to search for words under the cursor. In R, there will probably be a variable being assigned with <-, so you can go to the beginning using ^ to the first character then press * and n to follow that variable. Repeat ^ * n to follow the logic to the end. Can be turned into a macro.
