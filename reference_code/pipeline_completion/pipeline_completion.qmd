title: Pipeline completion documentation
---

# Introduction
This documentation serves as an explanation for the files found in directory ~/lab_utils/reference_code/pipeline_completion/.
The purpose of these scripts is to test combinations of parameters for the commands deeptools, macs2 and meme.
The files used are positive controls from one of my experiments and from a reference article (Eaton 2010).
Most of the scripts use the files from their directory locations but I realized that it was better to copy the files to the testing directory.
I also downloaded the data to my dropbox to have it available without having to use a vpn to access the cluster (sometimes it never connects and I have to restart my computer).
