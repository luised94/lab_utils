# macs2 not enough peaks for model building
WARNING @ Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:26:17: Too few paired peaks (80) so I can not build the model! Broader your MFOLD range parameter may erase this error. If it still can't build the model, we suggest to use --nomodel and --extsize 147 or other fixed number instead.
WARNING @ Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:26:17: Process for pairing-model is terminated!
WARNING @ Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:26:17: # Can't find enough pairs of symmetric peaks to build model!

Samples with poor quality data or negative controls can give this error. Extend mfold for model building or disable extsize.

# macs2 does not recognize the parameter
Control was being passed from associated array as "--control ${INPUT_CONTROL}" whereas it needed to be ( --control ${INPUT_CONTROL}) as a separate argument.

bigwig_metadata_df[row_index, ] <- split_metadata[[row_index]]
Add NA using: c(split_metadata[[row_index]], NA)
This will add a column named NA as well.
Can also do:
bigwig_metadata_df[row_index, 1:3] <- split_metadata[[row_index]]

If the split metadata were to change, I can calculate length of elements being assigned and adjust the dimensions to subset the dataframe columns while the data is being assigned. I would have to ensure that it is unique or adjust dynamically based on the row.
