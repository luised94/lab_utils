Error in `[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, row_index, , value = c("input", "deduped",  :
  replacement has 3 items, need 4

bigwig_metadata_df[row_index, ] <- split_metadata[[row_index]]
Add NA using: c(split_metadata[[row_index]], NA)
This will add a column named NA as well.
Can also do:
bigwig_metadata_df[row_index, 1:3] <- split_metadata[[row_index]]

If the split metadata were to change, I can calculate length of elements being assigned and adjust the dimensions to subset the dataframe columns while the data is being assigned. I would have to ensure that it is unique or adjust dynamically based on the row.
