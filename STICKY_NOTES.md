# STICKY NOTES
This note is just a section that documents thoughts and comments while I am developing the code in this directory.
I have separated it into dates.

- Most of the bash code I wrote for my CHIP-seq analysis previously served only to run R code.
- Need to see how I read feature files.
- Can definitely the quality control with bash (deeptools or other)
- Think I finally understand how I was coding. I was essentially debugging and testing but leaving it in that state.
- Furthermore, I think I was using weird unintuitive approaches and building on top of it if it worked.
- Need to output environment info after I finish analysis with git info.
- Installed all packages in 1-package-installation.r. I am reworking this file so I will just have to remember to document installed and used pakcages.
- Was able to replace most the initial part of the pipeline with bash instead of R.
- Copied rsync files from previous code collecition  because it had useful parts to extract.
- Finally went through old code collection for bioinformatics analysis.
